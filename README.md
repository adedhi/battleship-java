# Battleship Game
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/adedhi/battleship-java)

This is a Java implementation of the classic game Battleship. This program allows players to compete against the computer in a turn-based naval combat simulation. It provides a command-line interface for players to input their moves and track the progress of the game. The computer uses a random ship placement algorithm and an intelligent strategy for choosing hit positions, allowing it to keep track of the player's ships.

## Features
- Command-line interface for playing Battleship.
- Player vs. Computer gameplay.
- Randomized computer ship placement.
- Intelligent algorithm for choosing computer hit position.
- Colourful display using ANSI escape sequences for a better user experience.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command-line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, etc.)

## Installation
1. Download the code.

## Usage
1. Run the program (the main file is BattleshipMain.java).
3. Follow the prompts in the command line to play the game.

## Gameplay
- The game board is represented by a 10x10 grid.
- Each player (you and the computer) has five ships of different lengths to place on the board.
- Players take turn guessing the positions of each other's ships by providing coordinates.
- The first player to sink all the opponent's ships wins the game.
